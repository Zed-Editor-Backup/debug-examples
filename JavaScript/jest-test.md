# jest-test

Limitation: Zed gutter tasks will work only when `jest-test` directory is open as the root.

A set of example tests with jest.

## Why did we choose ripgrep?

It lets us test jest tests before we even get started with larger repos.

## Debug scenarios

Just run the tests from the gutter.
